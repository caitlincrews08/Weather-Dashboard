Here's the link to my [Weather_Dashboard](https://caitlincrews08.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/).

## Description
This website was developed as part of my week 6 homework assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Central Florida. The website consits of a weather dashboard that displays detailed information about todays weather in a given city and a 5 day forecast.

When the website deploys, there is an empty input box prompting the user to enter a city name. When the user presses the search button, todays weather displays to the right along with the city name, date, and weather icon. Below this, a 5 day forecast for the given city is displayed along with the appropriate date. The weather displayed in the forecast section is equivalent to 3:00 pm everyday. Below the search bar, the city name and information is displayed and saved in local storage. If the user enters a different city, that city is added to the list of previously searched cities below the search bar. These cities are clickable and will display their weather information when clicked. When the user refreshes the page, their previous searches remain on the screen and their most recently searched city's weather information is displayed.
